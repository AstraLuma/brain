<div class="markdown-help">
  <h3>Markdown basics:</h3>

<pre>
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5 
(looks like header 4 in most browsers)

This is a paragraph, 
which is text surrounded 
by whitespace. Paragraphs 
can be on one line (or many), 
and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to 
[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org), 
and a literal &lt;http://link.com/&gt;.

You can link to other pages 
in the wiki like this: 
[another page in the wiki](another-page)

**note the wiki page id is 
just the thing in the parentheses**

Here's a link to [the wiki home page](index).

Now some inline markup like 
_italics_
**bold**
`code()`

### Images are easy

![picture alt](/_utils/image/logo.png "Title")     

> Blockquotes are like quoted 
> text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

Another paragraph, this one 
is longer: Lorem ipsum dolor 
sit amet, consectetur adipisicing 
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore 
magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim 
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation 
ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip 
ex ea commodo consequat.

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

### Horizontal rules

* * * *

--------------------------

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();
    // it's indented by 4 spaces

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

_That's it, folks!_
